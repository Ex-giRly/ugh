    <h1>Hello, World!(Meet Alba❤️)</h1>
    <p>Alba is a walking daydream wrapped in pink sparkles and giggles 💖. With bows in her hair and glitter on her cheeks, she
    twirls through life like every hallway is a runway. Her laugh sounds like bubblegum popping, and she’s never without her
    heart-shaped sunglasses—even on cloudy days. Alba adores handwritten notes, plushie collections, and anything with
    strawberry icing. She’s the kind of girl who names her nail polish shades and gives pep talks to her plants. Sweet but
    sassy, soft but unstoppable—Alba is a pastel powerhouse with a heart full of love and a purse full of lip gloss. 💕✨
